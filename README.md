## About me

I am a positive-thinking person who possesses two sides of power. On one hand, I am organized, structured and attentive to detail due to my background as a construction management professional. On the other, due to my personality, I love to communicate with people and solve problems.

I got my Bachelor's Degree from the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT), Alberta, Canada. I also have 1+ year of experience  as a Data Analyst, 4+ years of Sales and customer service experience.

Now, I wish to develop my research and data analytical skills. 

I would be extremely happy to apply the obtained knowledge to analyze and solve real business problems and gain hands-on experience. It is a crucial step in my current career goal — to become a mid-level Data Analyst in 2 years.
